Okay, I need to generate a technical documentation in Markdown based on the provided code context. Let me start by breaking down each file to understand the project.

First, looking at app.py: it's a Flask application that registers the API blueprint from routes.py. The static files are served from the frontend folder.

modelos.py defines a Task class with id, content, and state attributes.

repositorio.py handles loading and saving tasks from a JSON file (tasks.json). It uses the Task model.

routes.py sets up the Flask API endpoints: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for tasks. There's validation in each route to handle errors properly.

The test files check that the models and repository work as expected.

Now, I need to structure the documentation according to the specified sections. Let me outline each section first.

1. **Visión General del Proyecto y Flujo de Datos Clave**: This should be narrative. I'll describe what the system does in simple terms.
2. **Arquitectura del Sistema y Endpoints de la API**: Technical with tables and Mermaid diagrams. I need to map out the components and their relationships, then list all API endpoints from routes.py.
3. **Instrucciones de Instalación**: Step-by-step commands. From looking at app.py, it's a Flask app that needs frontend static files. So maybe pip install dependencies, run the app.
4. **Flujo de Datos Clave**: This seems to be another narrative section explaining data flow (e.g., how tasks are created, updated).
5. **Extensiones Futuras**: Any hints from the code? For example, if there's a comment about future features or missing parts in the codebase.

I need to check for any clues on future extensions. The current code seems basic; maybe adding user authentication or more complex task states would be next steps.

Let me start drafting each section with these ideas in mind.

Starting with the title:
# Proyecto Tareas: API RESTful para Gestión de Tareas

Then, following the structure:

## Visión General del Proyecto y Flujo de Datos Clave
Explain that this is a simple task management system using Flask and JSON storage. Data flows from frontend to backend via API endpoints.

For Arquitectura:
- Use Mermaid diagram for components (Flask app, Repository, Task model)
- Table listing all routes with methods, paths, descriptions.

Installation instructions: steps like installing dependencies, setting up the directory structure, running the server.

Data flow section again narrative, but maybe more detailed than the overview.

Future extensions: perhaps based on what's missing in the code. For example, error handling improvements, adding user roles, etc.

I need to make sure I don't add any explanation before the title. Let me check each step carefully.
