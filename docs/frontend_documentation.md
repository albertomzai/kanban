Okay, I need to act as a software architect and technical writer expert. My task is to generate comprehensive documentation in Markdown based solely on the provided code context.

First, let me analyze the given code snippet from index.html. It's an HTML file for a Kanban board with three columns: To Do, In Progress, Done. There are draggable cards that can be moved between columns via drag-and-drop interactions. The JavaScript handles rendering tasks, dragging logic, and API calls to update task states.

I need to follow the specified structure:
1. **Visión General del Proyecto y Flujo de Datos Clave** - narrative style
2. **Arquitectura del Sistema y Endpoints de la API** - technical with tables and Mermaid diagrams
3. **Instrucciones de Instalación** - numbered list with exact commands
4. **Extensiones Futuras** - optional section based on inferred future plans

Starting with the title. The project is called "Kanban Board" from the HTML title tag.

For the Vision General section, I'll describe the purpose and flow of data in a narrative way.
For Architecture, I'll need to create tables for system components and API endpoints. Since there's no additional info beyond the index.html, I'll infer based on the code:
- The frontend uses Bootstrap
- It communicates with a backend via /api/tasks (POST) and /api/tasks/{id} (PUT)
- There are client-side JavaScript functions handling drag operations and form submissions

In the Installation section, I'll outline steps to run this project. Since it's just an HTML file, maybe they need a server or similar. I'll add notes about that.

For Future Extensions, from the code there might be opportunities like:
- Adding task priorities
- Integrating with other tools (Jira, Trello)
- Real-time updates via WebSockets
- Mobile responsiveness improvements

Important: Must start directly with the title, no extra text before it.
